# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Created simple HTML website Template using minimal CSS and bootstrap

**Thoughts:** This was a fun bootstrap project. I liked using the cards and the bootstrap forms.

### Day 2: November 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created medium complexity HTML website Template using minimal CSS and bootstrap. It 

**Thoughts:** This one was a little more involved than the project from day one. I will likely work on this one for a few days this week. I had some trouble working with my hero banner. I think I still need to make it more responsive.

### Day 3: November 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Updated the website template I was working on yesterday. I plan on working on it day by day over the next week to finish. 

**Thoughts:** Went pretty well today. Figured out a pretty straightforward methodology to working on the grid system.(I added borders and backgrounds to all the divs while doing the formatting, lmao). Anyway, good day, cool project. One day at a time!

### Day 4: November 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Static webpage is going well!

**Thoughts:** Made changes to the banners. I converted them to bootstrap cards with images and overlays. Also learned how to center the content effectively. Something I would like to learn still is to adjust the sizing. I'm pretty sure the issue is with the original image sizes. But, we'll see, haha.

### Day 5: November 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Static webpage last dev(Kinda)

**Thoughts:** Did the last of the major development for the webpage today. All that's left for this page is little todo's here and there. Bootstrap expedited this process so much.

### Day 6: November 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Static webpage last dev(actual)

**Thoughts:** I finished all the todos. There was considerably more than I expected, lol. That being said, it was a fun project and I don't hate how it looks. I will be doing another one starting tomorrow.

### Day 7: November 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Static webpage 2 initial Dev + Github Changes

**Thoughts:** I did the basic markup for the first page. I also changed the github repo to be "Static Web Pages" instead of doing a repo for each individual page. This may have been a mistake, as I now cannot figure out how to link directly to each folder. I'm not really upset with this method, though. I'm okay with having all of them in one place and centralizing the files keeps me from cluttering up my github. I also started back using the github cli. I'd used it before for a robotics project, so I'm a little rusty. But, It'll be fun to get back in the groove of using it.

### Day 8: November 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Static webpage 2

**Thoughts:** I forgot to update the log yesterday, but, I did update the static webpage header. The changes weren't overly extensive, but, I basically changed the mark up to utilize bootstrap's formatting.

### Day 9: November 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Express App 1

**Thoughts:** These changes were pretty extensive and fun to do. I moved the header and footer into ejs templates. The body is now the home page and now the news and pricing page links work. Still a far cry away from being a full webpage or anything, but, a fun exercise regardless. I am enjoying the 100 days of code more and more each day.

**Today's Progress**: Created medium complexity HTML website Template using minimal CSS and bootstrap. It 

**Thoughts:** This one was a little more involved than the project from day one. I will likely work on this one for a few days this week. I had some trouble working with my hero banner. I think I still need to make it more responsive.

### Day 3: November 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Updated the website template I was working on yesterday. I plan on working on it day by day over the next week to finish. 

**Thoughts:** Went pretty well today. Figured out a pretty straightforward methodology to working on the grid system.(I added borders and backgrounds to all the divs while doing the formatting, lmao). Anyway, good day, cool project. One day at a time!

### Day 4: November 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Static webpage is going well!

**Thoughts:** Made changes to the banners. I converted them to bootstrap cards with images and overlays. Also learned how to center the content effectively. Something I would like to learn still is to adjust the sizing. I'm pretty sure the issue is with the original image sizes. But, we'll see, haha.

### Day 4: November 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Static webpage last dev(Kinda)

**Thoughts:** Did the last of the major development for the webpage today. All that's left for this page is little todo's here and there. Bootstrap expedited this process so much.
